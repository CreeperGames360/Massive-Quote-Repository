# Quote Repository Version 1.5b-cnsr86xt

Description:
**"Hello! This Markdown document is a collection of EVERY quote I could find from every source, and there may be frequent updates. Incase a source gets taken down on it's origin I will have an archive that will be in the files in a specific folder. I do not condone copyright infringement, and this is suggested under the "Fair Use" law, which includes reaction to video with medium or heavy commentary, and yes, even archival. If ANYTHING you find here violates copyright laws, email me at my business email: butshandos@gmail.com. I should be able to get back to you within 2-6 business days or 2 weeks tops depending, and we can sort things out."**
